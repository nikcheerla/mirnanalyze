<p>We sought to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of 21 different types of cancers using cell-free miRNA. <a href = "http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/740459">Cell-free miRNA</a> are a recently discovered type of genetic material whose expression levels can be measured with a blood test. We built different machine learning models based on tissue miRNA and cell-free miRNA that make it possible to both diagnose any cancer with a simple blood test, and recommend personalized treatment regimens tailored to a patients's miRNA profile. </p>

<p>Work on this project was conducted with the mentorship of Dr. Olivier Geveart at the Stanford School of Medicine.
