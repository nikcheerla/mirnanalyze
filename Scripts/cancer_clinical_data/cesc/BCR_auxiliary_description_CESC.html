    Human papilloma virus (HPV) status in TCGA qualified cervical tumors was evaluated by the Biospecimen Core Resource at Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital (TCGA Center 23).  A PCR based MassArray Assay developed at the University of Michigan was performed to test a panel of 18 HPV types (HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV39, HPV45, HPV51, HPV52, HPV56, HPV58, HPV59, HPV66, HPV68, HPV73 and HPV90).  Multiplex PCR & Sequenom based Mass Spectrometry was used to detect the presence of specific HPV types based on the DNA sequence heterogeneity found within individual viral E6 regions.  Tumor DNA was classified as HPV Positive or Negative based on the reproducible detection or failure to detect one of the HPV types included in the panel.  If positive for a single HPV type or more, the specific HPV type identified is specified in the &#8220;MassArray_HPV_Call&#8221; columns.  Tumor DNA that did not reproducibly detect the presence of HPV was classified as Indeterminate.
